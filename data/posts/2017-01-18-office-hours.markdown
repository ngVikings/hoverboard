# Office Hours

As you already know, we invited [30 famous Angular heroes](/speakers/) to present and hold the workshops for you at ngVikings. You will meet them all during their talks, hands-on sessions, big conference party, coffee breaks, lunches, etc. We bet, you have many questions to our heroes about topics they presented, you need advices for your projects, you want to follow best practices. Unfortunately not all the time frames work fine for the speaker-attendee discussion. This is why we introduce Office Hours!

This is a unique possibility to ask the questions and get consulted by our speakers in a quiet and friendly environment. 30 minutes, 5 speakers in the room, panel-like discussion.

To get a full agenda please check the [schedule of Conference Day](/schedule/day1). We open a separate Office Hours track right after the lunch at 13:40.
